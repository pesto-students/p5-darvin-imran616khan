            <h1>Greece</h1>
            <p>Greece is a country in Southeast Europe. It is situated on the southern tip of the Balkans, and is
                located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
            <p>Stunning Santorini is the most dramatic of all the Greek isles. It is best known for the west coast
                cliff-top towns of Fira and Oia, which appear to hang over a deep, blue sea-filled caldera. Made up of
                typical Cycladic whitewashed cubic buildings, many of which have been converted into boutique hotels
                with infinity pools, both Fira and Oia are considered romantic destinations, popular for weddings and
                honeymoons.</p>
